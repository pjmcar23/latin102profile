# Translation 3: Three labors of Hercules

Glossary and notes
Note: 
- the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! 
- If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun,
  you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). 
  This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

## Vocabulary:

- Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
- bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
- caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
- Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
- purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
- quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
- stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

## Passage to analyze

Hyginus, chapter 30, sections 7-9.

7. Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die purgavit, maiorem partem Iove adiutore; flumine admisso totum stercus abluit.

9. Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, qui carne humana vescebantur, cum Abdero famulo interfecit; equorum autem nomina Podargus Lampon Xanthus Dinus.

## A. Grammatical analysis
- Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination.
- Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.

7.  Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die *purgavit*,

    maiorem partem 
    
    > Iove adiutore; 
    
    > flumine admisso
   
    totum stercus *abluit*.

8.  taurum 
    
    > cum quo Pasiphae *concubuit* 
    
    ex Creta insula Mycenis vivum *adduxit*.

9.  Diomedem Thraciae regem et equos quattuor eius, 
    
    > qui carne humana *vescebantur*,

##  C. Literary commentary
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. 
Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences.
Italicize Latin words when citing them.

*maiorem partem*: Hyginus uses these words to emphasize the size and importance of the stalls that Hercules is cleaning. The word order, translated is the major part. This helps us understand how much Hercules had to clean.

*flumine admisso*: Hyginus uses these words to add more information on how Hercules cleaned the stalls in a short amount of time.
