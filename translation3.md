# Translation 3: Three labors of Hercules

Glossary and notes
Note: 
- the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! 
- If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun,
  you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). 
  This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

## Vocabulary:

- Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
- bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
- caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
- Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
- purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
- quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
- stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”
