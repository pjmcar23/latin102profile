**Needs revisions**
**It would probably be easiest if you grouped together the three questions about each sentence: translate the relative pronoun into Latin, identify the antecedent, and identify the case of the Latin pronoun.  If you try to review this from just a list of forms or of cases, it will be hard to sort out.**

## Part 2: English relative clauses

You are given a pair of simple English sentences (that is, a single independent clause) with a noun in common.
Combine them into one complex sentence by keeping the first sentence as the independent clause, and making the second sentence a relative clause.

Example: if you were given

> Hercules was ordered by Eurystheus to perform twelve labors. Eurystheus was the son of Sthenelus.

you could make the second sentence a relative clause like this:

> Hercules was ordered by Eurystheus, who was the son of Sthenelus, to perform twelve labors.

1. The brothers were violent Centaurs. Eurytion came to the wedding with his brothers.
> Eurytion came to the wedding with his brothers, who were violent Centaurs.❌**You've flipped the sentences: keep sentence 1 as the main clause.** `The brothers, who cam to the wedding with Eurytion, were violent Centaurs.`

> Deanira was promised in marriage to Eurytion, who Dexamenus was afraid of.
