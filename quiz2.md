## Part 2: English relative clauses

You are given a pair of simple English sentences (that is, a single independent clause) with a noun in common.
Combine them into one complex sentence by keeping the first sentence as the independent clause, and making the second sentence a relative clause.

Example: if you were given

> Hercules was ordered by Eurystheus to perform twelve labors. Eurystheus was the son of Sthenelus.

you could make the second sentence a relative clause like this:

> Hercules was ordered by Eurystheus, who was the son of Sthenelus, to perform twelve labors.
