# Commenting on Latin Reading

## Option A

As you did in translation 2, please select two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading, 
and comment briefly on how Hyginus’ choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content.

Discuss briefly: no more than 2-4 sentences for each example. 
Italicize Latin words when citing them.

You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.

### Two Choices of Syntax

1. *flumen magnum, cui nomen Evenus erat*: Hyginus deeply explains the river in the syntax. Describing how large the river is with the term *magnum* and describing the name of the river with *cui nomen Evenus erat*.
2. *sagittas Hydrae Lernaeae felle tinctas magnum vim habere*: In this statement, Hyginus explains the means of the arrows used to kill Nessus. It really explains how the arrows were covered in the potent bile of the Hydra Lerna.
